A cat clicker app with several iterations. Built with Knockout and jQuery.
Initial version defaults to two cats with independent click counters, a button to add more cats, and another button to simultaneously increcment all cat's counters. App uses Namely to randomly assign a name for each new cat.

Version 2 will use a selection mechanism to display chosen cat's info and will begin with 5 cats. I will use Knockout to also allow editing of chosen cat's name. Also plan to use Flickr api to randomly assign each cat a pic.
